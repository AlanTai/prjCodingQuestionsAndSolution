Rise of the zombits
===================

Could it be? Professor Boolean has managed to mutate some of your rabbit kin into zombie rabbits! The mad scientist decides to call them zombits, and appears to be building an army for some nefarious purpose. You must stop him, but first you must find out the size of the problem.

This strange new species follows a precise life cycle. At noon, on their second birthday, they give birth to 3 zombits. At noon, on their third birthday, they give birth to 2 zombits and at noon on their sixth birthday, they give birth to one zombit. They live for exactly 10 years (so if a zombit was born at 12:31 a.m., January 1, year 3, then it will die at 12:31 a.m., January 1, year 13).

We are interested studying the growth of the zombit population starting from one zombit which was created at 12:01 a.m. on January 1, year 0 (assume all years have a fixed number of days). 

Write a function answer(n) that returns the zombit population at 1:00 a.m., January 1, year n, where n is 0 to 30.
